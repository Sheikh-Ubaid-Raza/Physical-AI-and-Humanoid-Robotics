# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

A comprehensive 13-week curriculum for Computer Science and Engineering students learning Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2, and embodied intelligence.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive 13-week Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook website built with Docusaurus v3.x and deployed on GitHub Pages. The implementation includes 26 structured chapters with learning objectives, code examples, exercises, and summaries. The site features responsive design, syntax-highlighted code examples for Python/YAML/XML, Mermaid diagrams for ROS 2 architecture, and an automated GitHub Actions deployment pipeline.

## Local Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git for version control

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.
