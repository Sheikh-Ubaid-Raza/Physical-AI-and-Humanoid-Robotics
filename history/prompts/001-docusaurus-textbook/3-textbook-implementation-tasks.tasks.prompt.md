  Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The tasks.md file now includes:

  81 total tasks across 8 phases:
  - Phase 1 (Setup): 13 tasks - Project initialization and configuration
  - Phase 2 (Foundational): 11 tasks - Core functionality implementation
  - Phase 3 (US1 - Access Content): 13 tasks - Textbook content creation
  - Phase 4 (US2 - Execute Examples): 10 tasks - Code examples and execution
  - Phase 5 (US3 - Navigate/Search): 6 tasks - Navigation and search functionality
  - Phase 6 (US4 - Multi-device Access): 6 tasks - Responsive design and accessibility
  - Phase 7 (US5 - Deploy/Maintain): 5 tasks - Deployment pipeline setup
  - Phase 8 (Polish): 13 tasks - Quality assurance and optimization

  All tasks follow the required format with proper IDs, story labels [US1-US5], and file paths. The task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities have been identified. Each user story phase includes independent test criteria and is organized for incremental development with working software at each phase.

  The implementation plan enables:
  - Complete 13-week curriculum with 26 chapters
  - Full code example integration with syntax highlighting
  - Responsive design for multiple device types
  - Automated deployment pipeline
  - Quality assurance and performance optimization
outcome: "All implementation tasks generated and organized by user story priorities"
evaluation: "Tasks comprehensively cover all requirements from the specification with proper organization by user story priorities. Each task is specific enough for independent implementation and testing."
